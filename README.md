# Credit-Risk-Predictive-Modeling
“Predict a customer will pay the financing or not! By Machine Learning using Python programming” A mini-project on a bank dataset. There is a need to analyze whether a particular client will repay the credit or not to the bank. Though it's a supervised dataset, first need to analyze it then develop a ML model to solve the problem and test the accuracy of the model. Problem Statement: This is a project to forecast a specific customer to reward a credit or not. The data is collected from the URL - https://www.kaggle.com/upadorprofzs/credit-risk The dataset contains 2000 rows and 5 columns only. There are - 'clientid', 'income', 'age', 'loan', 'default' attributes are present. All the attributes have numerical values and only 'default'column has binary (1/0) values. According to the dataset explanation this is a supervised classification problem. Here, presents a binary dependent variable. So, can assume the result will also be in a binary format(yes=0 &amp; no=1). Logistic regression is a statistical method of classification problem. It is just one part of ML used for solving this kind of binary classification problem. Working with this dataset I have achieved maximum accuracy is 0.897 and AUC is 0.954 .  So,can say most of the clients will repay their financing.
